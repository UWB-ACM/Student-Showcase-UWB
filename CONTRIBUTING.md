# Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to the list are greatly appreciated and always welcome. Feel free to add and reorganize items and categories as you see fit.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

-   Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
-   Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
-   If adding/modifying an entry, use a format that is consistent with the rest of the entries. General format:
    `[NAME](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
-   Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
-   End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
-   Check your spelling and grammar.
-   Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
